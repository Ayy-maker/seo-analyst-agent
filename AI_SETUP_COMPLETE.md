## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Current State (Without AI):
```
Priority Actions:
  ⚡ 0 Quick Wins
  🎯 0 High Impact
  📊 0 Strategic

Insights:
  - Generic template advice
  - No industry-specific context
  - No competitive benchmarking
  - No ROI estimates
```

### Future State (With AI):

> Current: "Our Services"
>
> **Recommendation:**
> "Expert SEO consulting, website optimization, and digital marketing services to grow your business. Get a free audit today."
>
> **Impact:**
> - Estimated CTR increase: +2.5% (from 0.8% → 3.3%)
> - Additional monthly clicks: +42
> - Implementation time: 30 minutes

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Test with Real Data First
```
Don't go straight to client reports.
Generate 2-3 test reports first to verify quality.
```

### 2. Monitor API Usage
```
Check Anthropic console weekly
Typical usage: $1-2/month
Alert if usage > $5/month (something wrong)
```

### 3. Keep API Key Secure
```
Never commit to git (already in .gitignore)
File permissions: 600 (already set)
Rotate key quarterly (security best practice)
```

### 4. Validate Recommendations
```
AI is smart but not perfect
Always sanity-check specific recommendations
Verify numbers match actual data
```
