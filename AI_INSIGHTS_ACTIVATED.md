## 📊 AI Recommendation Quality

### Example AI-Generated Recommendation:

**Title:** "Optimize the homepage (/) for 'profit analytics platform' and 'business profit tracking software'..."

**Main Recommendation:**
> Optimize the homepage (/) for 'profit analytics platform' and 'business profit tracking software' (estimated 1,200+ combined monthly searches) by adding 1,200-word SEO content section below the fold, targeting position 8-12 within 60 days to capture the 585 impressions already showing.

**Why (AI Reasoning):**
> Homepage has highest impressions (585) but only 1 click and 0.3% CTR—massive opportunity gap. Currently ranking position 57.2 for generic queries. Adding optimized content can push into page 2 (positions 11-20) quickly given your domain's momentum. SaaS homepages that balance conversion optimization with SEO content see 40-60% impression growth without sacrificing conversion rates.

**Data Evidence:**
- Homepage: 585 impressions, 1 click, 0.3% CTR—underperforming visibility
- Position 57.2 indicates appearing for relevant queries but lacking relevance signals
- Monthly position improvement of 6.5 positions suggests quick ranking gains possible

**Impact Metrics:**
- **Impact Score:** 4.3/10
- **Effort Score:** 2/10 (Low effort!)
- **ROI Score:** 2.1
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks

**Expected Impact:**
> Est. +45-65 clicks/month, +2-3 demo requests, $6,000-9,000 ARR
