## ❌ Issues Found

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Production Reports:
**Always generate via web interface** (https://seo.theprofitplatform.com.au):
- ✅ Auto-fetches real GSC + GA4 data
- ✅ Runs AI analysis (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- ✅ Generates strategic recommendations
- ✅ Populates all data tables
- ✅ Includes historical tracking

### For Future Test Reports:
1. Include realistic demo data for queries/pages/devices
2. Run through AI analysis pipeline
3. Show what production reports will look like

### Address Low Performance:
The baseline data shows **critical SEO issues:**
- Position 57 = Invisible to 99% of searchers
- 5 clicks/month = Essentially no traffic
- 0.30% CTR = People scroll past even when shown

**Priority Actions:**
1. Improve rankings to page 1-2 (positions 1-20)
2. Expand keyword targeting
3. Optimize for higher-volume queries
4. Improve CTR with better meta descriptions
