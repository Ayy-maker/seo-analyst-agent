## How These Were Generated

These examples were created by running:

```bash
python main.py analyze --reports data/samples/*.csv
```

The system:
1. Parsed the sample CSV files
2. Analyzed keywords and technical data
3. Generated insights with the Analyst Agent
4. Validated insights with the Critic Agent
5. Formatted outputs with the Reporter Agent

## Real-World Usage

When you run the system with your own data:

```bash
python main.py analyze --reports data/your-search-console-export.csv
```

You'll get similar files in `outputs/`:
- `outputs/summaries/executive-summary-TIMESTAMP.md`
- `outputs/action-plans/action-plan-TIMESTAMP.md`
- `outputs/summaries/MODULE-report-TIMESTAMP.md`
- `outputs/dashboards/dashboard-data-TIMESTAMP.json`

## Customization

To customize the output format:
1. Edit agent prompts in `config/prompts/`
2. Modify reporter templates in `agents/reporter/formatter.py`
3. Adjust thresholds in `config/env.json`

## Integration Examples

### Notion
Import Markdown files directly or use Notion API to create pages programmatically.

### Google Sheets
Parse JSON file and push to Google Sheets via API (Phase 2).

### Slack
Send executive summary or critical alerts to Slack channel (Phase 3).

### Email
Attach Markdown/PDF reports to automated email reports (Phase 2).

## Data Used

Based on sample data in `data/samples/`:
- 15 keywords from Search Console
- 15 pages from technical audit

Real reports will have much more data and generate more comprehensive insights.

## Notes

- Example outputs demonstrate Phase 1 MVP capabilities
- Keywords and Technical modules are fully implemented
- On-page, Backlinks, and Traffic modules coming in future phases
- All insights are validated before inclusion in reports
- Severity and priority are automatically determined based on config thresholds
