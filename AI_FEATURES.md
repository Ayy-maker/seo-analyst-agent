## AI Features in Reports

### 1. Executive Summary (AI-Generated)
**What It Does:**
- Analyzes all uploaded data
- Generates narrative summary of SEO performance
- Highlights key wins and challenges
- Provides business context

**Example Output:**
```
"Your organic search performance shows strong momentum in Q4 2025,
with a 34% increase in qualified traffic from commercial intent
keywords. While technical health remains excellent (87/100),
there's an opportunity to capitalize on 12 high-volume keywords
currently ranking positions 4-10 that could drive an estimated
2,500 additional monthly visitors with focused optimization."
```

### 2. Strategic Recommendations (AI-Enhanced)
**What It Does:**
- Analyzes performance across all modules
- Prioritizes actions by impact/effort ratio
- Provides implementation guidance
- Considers industry trends

**Example Output:**
```
1. Quick Win: Optimize 5 pages ranking positions 4-7
   (Est. impact: 1,200 monthly clicks)

2. Content Gap: Target "commercial keywords" with
   buyer intent showing 300% growth

3. Technical: Fix 12 crawl errors on product pages
   affecting 15% of site indexation
```

### 3. Performance Insights (AI-Powered)
**What It Does:**
- Identifies patterns humans might miss
- Connects cause and effect across metrics

- Suggests testing strategies

**Example Output:**
```
Strength: Mobile traffic grew 45% while desktop remained flat,
suggesting successful mobile-first optimization efforts.

Opportunity: Pages with video content show 2.3x engagement,
but only 12% of pages utilize video. Expanding video strategy
could significantly boost dwell time and rankings.
```

### 4. Anomaly Detection (AI-Driven)
**What It Does:**
- Detects unusual traffic patterns
- Identifies ranking fluctuations
- Alerts to technical issues
- Flags potential Google algorithm impacts

**Example Output:**
```
Alert: 23% drop in blog traffic on Nov 15 coincides with
Google's November core update. Affected pages share similar
characteristics (thin content, high ad density).
Recommendation: Content depth audit for impacted sections.
